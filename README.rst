mythril
=======

``mythril`` is a lightweight library for producing and consuming, formatting and displaying disparate and varied data (e.g., in a Web App) in, again, a light and feature-separated (read: DRY) way. If you have lots of little "Model" classes, multiple inputand output sources/formats, gangly "Views" and you're pulling out your hair, this library may be for you.

It also includes a number of utilities for fine-grained and remote control of Web "widgets".
